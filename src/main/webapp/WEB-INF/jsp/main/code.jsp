					So this is the area of my site where I do some stuff with various forms of code.  Not all of it is intensive
					in the slightest, and the majority of it is likely readable by non-programmer type people.  Anyways this is also
					the portion of the site that will get updated the most, seeing as how I'm a computer nerd and all.
				</p>
				<p>
					Basically it might be worth it to stop back here every once in a while to check for updates, especially if
					you have some interest in computers.  As for now I just have some random pictures from and of outer space,
					which if you've been around long enough will recognize from that past two versions of this site.  I also
					have some <a target="_blank" href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> solutions in both Python (it's been a while)
					and JAVA (which is what I wrote when I made this web page).  More to come!
				</p>
				<p>
					Enjoy!
