			Hi there,
		</h1>
	
		<p class="info">
			My name is Sully and I'm a JAVA engineer, specializing in making dynamic web applications for creating,
			editing, persisting, integrating, and/or converting data of various types.  Of course, 
			<span>
				<a href="http://www.springsource.org/" target="_blank">
					Spring Framework
				</a>
			</span> 
			is my favorite tool, along with Hibernate/JPA, JSR-303, JAX-B, XSTREAM, AWS (etc...)
			and I have now officially completely redone my site with a Spring back-end, as well as with
			<span>
				<a href="http://jqueryui.com/" target="_blank">
					jQuery UI
				</a>
			</span> 
			and
			<span>
				<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">
					Twitter Bootstrap
				</a>
			</span>
			's oh-so pretty base CSS.  I use my favorite hosting tool,
			<span>
				<a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/" target="_blank">
					Cloudbees
				</a>
			</span>
			to dynamically deploy this site using Jenkins whenever I commit to my Cloudbees-hosted repository.
			In addition, I've recently added some new technologies.  I'm now using quite a bit of MongoDB,
			including a grand total of 1 Map-Reduce function (and lots of other historic tables, such as currencies).  
			In addition, a bit of the site is now written entirely in Groovy; in particular, the 
			Cryptography page (under the 'Math' section) is 100% Groovy and UI.  
		</p>
		
		<p class="info">
			If you don't understand all that nonsense, don't worry; there is some random fun stuff on this site besides all my
			nerdy development stuff.  Basically I just tried to use some of the coolest and newest technologies available
			to JAVA developers to make this site!
		</p>
		
		<p class="info">
			Enjoy what little there is, please, and feel free to sign my guestbook!
